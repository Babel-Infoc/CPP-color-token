# JSON color token

This repo implements a language server for VSCode. The language server can be installed as an extension. The extension enables hex color token detection in JSON files and RGB array detection in C++ files. It provides color preview and color editing through the built-in color picker.

## Example

A json file with hex color tokens

```json
{
	"colorA": "#DB3333",
	"colorB": "#B9EC2B"
}
```

will be rendered as

If referenced in a css file, the referenced variables will show the color preview

Additionally, RGB array color definitions in C++ files are now supported:

```cpp
const int RED[] = {255, 0, 0};
const int GREEN[] = {0, 255, 0};
setColor({128, 128, 128}); // Medium gray
```

## Features

- Preview visual color from hex color tokens in json files.
- Preview visual color from RGB arrays in C++ files in format `{r,g,b}` where r, g, b are integers between 0-255.
- Cache variables in opened json files that are like color tokens and preview them in referenced css/less files.
- Adjust color using the built-in color picker in json files and C++ files.
